        <h2>Problem statement: Electronic Waste in the Modern World</h2>
        <p>The many computing devices in the modern world generate a large amount of electronic waste,
        and this has a negative effect on both the environment and economy.</p>

        <p>Juan Vazquez III</p>
        <p>"What's that called on the App Store?"</p>
        <p>Juan is a Gen Z technology user. He only knows how to access the digital world through apps on his iPhone, has a
          limited grasp of what a filesystem is and hasn't used a desktop since the computer lab in 8th grade.</p>

        <a href="files/all-storyboards.pdf"><h2>Team Storyboards: ReHardware</h2></a>
        <p>Juan breaks his phone screen, and the app instructs him to give it information that allows it to 
          diagnose that the issue is simply a broken screen protector, which can be replaced easily. The app 
          saved him a trip to a repair shop, and he even might have replaced the phone if not for its guidance.</p>

        <p>Our app provides a variety of functionality to address the main goal of preventing premature replacement
          of technology and encouraging repair and renewal wherever possible. Users should be using devices in their
          best possible shape, and there's no need to use something old and broken just for sustainability reasons.
          Our app hopes to keep all the world's technology in great condition by renewing what we have already made
          and putting off replacements.</p>

        <a href="https://youtu.be/4w-PTzYE8Tw"><h2>Team Paper Prototype: ReHardware</h2></a>
        <p>This paper prototype showcases all of the possible screens that are featured in the app:
          The diagnosis flow, the part ordering marketplace, and the repair shop finder. In addition,
          it showcases the extensive customer support that ReHardware will offer, which will be necessary
          because this is such a complicated topic.</p>

        <a href="https://youtu.be/XD2W1RT-nlg"><h2>Team Hi-Fi Prototype: ReHardware</h2></a>
        <p>This hi-fi prototype shows all of the functionality of the app and how it will implement all
          features described in previous sections. The design is comparable to the real thing, and shows how the
          diagnosis service, part ordering marketplace, and repair shop finder would look in a final version of
          ReHardware app for mobile phones. Customer support flows are also included in the app.</p>
